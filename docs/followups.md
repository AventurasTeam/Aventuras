# Follow-ups

Top-level ledger of **active** outstanding items — design questions
or work the current milestone (v1) needs answered, or that block
other v1 work. Resolved items are **removed** (not crossed out); the
commit that resolves an item carries the resolution narrative.

Items confirmed for a future milestone or parked indefinitely
pending signal live in [`parked.md`](./parked.md). Movement between
the two files is normal as scope clarifies; see
[`conventions.md → Followups vs parked`](./conventions.md#followups-vs-parked)
for the placement rule.

## UX

### Custom-font theme support

Themes can declare font-family overrides in their registry entry
(e.g. Parchment maps `--font-reading` to a serif stack); the
runtime swap mechanism applies these overrides at theme-swap time.
**Verified during phase 1 native bring-up: the slot swap works,
but the resolved typeface doesn't change** because the font stacks
declared in [`themes.md`](./ui/foundations/themes.md) reference
fonts that aren't bundled with the app. Both web (Electron, RN-Web
in Storybook) and Android fall through to the same system
sans-serif default for every theme.

Open design questions:

- **Bundling strategy.** Ship font files in the app bundle (larger
  binary, fonts available immediately) or load lazily on first use
  of a font-overridable theme (smaller binary, first-render
  fallback flicker)?
- **Web loading strategy.** `@font-face` in `global.css`, separate
  font CSS, CDN-hosted variants, or accept system-fallback on web?
  Each has different first-paint implications for Electron.
- **Per-platform font-stack reconciliation.** A stack like
  `Charter, "Iowan Old Style", "Source Serif", Georgia, ...` falls
  through differently across iOS, Android, and web. Single stack
  with hopeful fallbacks vs per-platform stacks in the registry?
- **First-launch / reduced-data-mode UX.** What does the user see
  before custom fonts finish loading? Acceptable to render system
  sans first then re-flow once fonts arrive?

License + bundle-size accounting (redistribution rights for
Charter / Lora / etc., binary-weight impact) is implementation
work that follows from the bundling-strategy decision.

Lands when a v1 surface depends on a custom-font theme rendering
correctly. Until then, themes that declare font overrides function
as color-only themes — not a v1 blocker, but worth calling out so
the gallery contract isn't misread as "font-customization works
today."

### Sheet keyboard handling on mobile

[`patterns/overlays.md`](./ui/patterns/overlays.md) ships the
Sheet primitive contract but defers keyboard-aware behavior. When
a Sheet contains an Input (e.g. a search field at the top of a
long Select list) and the on-screen keyboard opens, the
`@rn-primitives/dialog` lifecycle layer ships no keyboard avoidance
— the sheet either gets covered or the input scrolls out of view.

Decisions needed:

- **Avoidance mechanism.** `KeyboardAvoidingView` wrapping
  `Sheet.Content` (consumer-side) vs an `avoidKeyboard` prop on
  Sheet itself (primitive-side). Consumer-side keeps the primitive
  small but forces every Input-hosting consumer to remember the
  wrap; primitive-side adds API surface but localizes the concern.
- **iOS / Android divergence.** Behavior is platform-divergent;
  KeyboardAvoidingView's `behavior` prop (`padding` / `position`
  / `height`) needs different values per platform.
- **Interaction with drag-to-dismiss.** When the keyboard is up,
  drag-to-dismiss must still work without colliding with the
  keyboard's own gesture surface.

Lands at the first Sheet implementation pass with a keyboard-
hosting consumer (likely Select on mobile with a search bar, per
[`calendar-picker.md → Implementation notes`](./ui/patterns/calendar-picker.md#implementation-notes)).

### Sheet + Popover ARIA contract

[`patterns/overlays.md`](./ui/patterns/overlays.md) defers the
explicit accessibility contract for both primitives. Open:

- **Sheet roles.** `role="dialog"` always, or `role="alertdialog"`
  when the sheet is dismiss-blocking? Pre-existing surface bindings
  (calendar swap, branch creation) all use Modal, not Sheet —
  Sheet's dismiss-blocking variant is theoretical for v1.
- **Popover roles.** `role="dialog"` with `aria-haspopup` on the
  trigger? `role="menu"` when the popover content is action-shaped
  (Actions menu, branch chip popover)? rn-primitives may default
  to one shape; consumer-driven override is worth specifying.
- **Labelling.** `aria-labelledby` pointing at a header element
  inside the content vs `aria-label` as a string prop on the
  primitive. Consistency across both primitives matters.
- **Focus-return semantics.** Default is "return to trigger";
  consumer override (e.g. focus a specific element in the parent)
  is sometimes wanted. Whether this is a primitive prop or a
  consumer concern.

Lands at the first Sheet / Popover implementation pass.

### Theme-audit CI gate

[`ui/foundations/color.md → Theme audit utility`](./ui/foundations/color.md#theme-audit-utility)
ships `pnpm themes:audit` as a dev-only command — runs over the
theme registry, prints pass/fail/warn per pair per theme, exits 0
even on failures (never blocks). Wiring it into CI (or
`pnpm test`) as a gate is **ripe for design** now that session 6
landed the curated gallery (per
[`ui/foundations/themes.md`](./ui/foundations/themes.md)). Real
palette data informs the exempt-list shape: Catppuccin Latte and
Catppuccin Mocha fail or sit close to AAA on body prose by
canonical design and need to be marked exempt before the gate
fires; other themes clear AAA with margin and don't.

Decisions needed at gate-wiring time:

- Which contrast targets gate (likely AA floors only; AAA target
  stays warning).
- Per-theme exempt list shape — a `theme.audit.exempt: [...]`
  field on the theme module, an external allow-list, or
  per-theme tags surfaced from the `Theme` type.
- The accent-overridable derivation sweep — does it gate, or
  stay informational-only?
- Whether the gate runs in pre-commit, in `pnpm test`, or as a
  dedicated CI job.

Lands at the gate's own design pass — session 6's palette data
is in hand, ready to inform the exempt-list shape.

### Search scope on state fields

Per
[`reader-composer.md → Browse rail — search scope`](./ui/screens/reader-composer/reader-composer.md#browse-rail--search-scope)
and
[`world.md → List pane — search scope`](./ui/screens/world/world.md#list-pane--search-scope),
entity search currently scans `name`, `description`, `tags`. With
the new
[`entities.state` shape](./data-model.md#world-state-storage),
several state fields carry user-facing text content worth
including in search:

- **Likely yes — `traits`, `drives`** (CharacterState chip lists,
  `agenda` for FactionState). Users will want to filter "all
  characters with `former soldier` trait" or "factions whose agenda
  mentions Vex."
- **Likely no — `voice`** (low search-value; prose stylistic note
  rather than searchable identity).
- **Edge cases — `visual.*`** sub-fields. "All red-haired
  characters" feels like a search you'd want, but the chip-style
  noise (every character has 6 visual slots, mostly populated) may
  flood unrelated search results.
- **Stackables keys** — searching "all characters with gold > 0" is
  a different shape (numeric filter, not text search); treat
  separately if real demand surfaces.

Decision lands with the next pass over the World panel + Browse
rail search-scope definition. Lean: include `traits` + `drives` +
`agenda` immediately when implementing the new shape; defer
`visual.*` until UX testing surfaces flooding-or-not-flooding signal.

### Translation rows in per-story export / import

Per-story exports now strip `stories.settings.models`,
`stories.settings.embedding_*`, and vec0 vectors (folded into
[`data-model.md → Backup & export format`](./data-model.md#backup--export-format)
during the provider/profile deletion-semantics design). Cached
translation rows weren't addressed — open whether they travel with
a per-story export and how they reconcile with the importer's
translation backend + language settings on the receiving end.
Lands at the next pass over translation pipeline / export format.

### Translation graceful degradation

A translation phase fatal failure currently aborts the entire
per-turn pipeline (per the framework's "fatal phase → transaction
abort" contract). User loses their AI response over a translation
provider hiccup. Harsh — the narrative is the primary user value;
translation is a display-time bonus.

The fix: translation phase declares its failures as recoverable at
the phase level (the narrative commits, the translation rows just
don't land for this turn). On next render of an entity / entry, the
translation lookup falls back to source language; the next opportunity
to re-translate (e.g., user edits the entity, or a deliberate
"re-translate this story" action) covers the gap.

Open sub-questions:

- **Where the soft-fail lives.** Inside the translation phase itself
  (catch, log a recoverable_error, return completed with empty
  `translationResult`) or via a wrapper that converts fatal-from-
  translation into recoverable? Probably former — translation phase
  knows its own degradation semantics.
- **Re-translation triggers.** Render-time lazy retry (each missing
  translation kicks off a one-off call) vs explicit user action
  ("retranslate this story"). Render-time lazy gets expensive fast;
  explicit user action is safer but loses the magic.
- **UX surface for failures.** Toast? Silent? Status pill flag for
  "some translations failed this turn"? Probably silent + diagnostic
  in dev mode.

Lands when translation phase is built. The framework already supports
the degradation pattern; this followup pins the policy.

### Actions menu broader design pass

The
[Diagnostics Hub](./ui/screens/diagnostics/diagnostics.md)
adds a single entry (`Open Diagnostics Hub`) to the global Actions
(⚲) menu. The menu has not yet had a focused design pass — its
full inventory, organizational shape (groups, separators, mobile
expression), and contextual variants per screen are
unspecified. Surfaced during the observability design
session; lands as its own pass when the next set of Actions-menu
candidates is ready (or when the menu's current sparseness
becomes a UX friction in real use).
