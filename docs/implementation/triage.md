# Implementation triage

Inbox for cross-cutting deferrals surfaced during implementation that
have **no single downstream slice to own them** — the items that would
otherwise be dropped straight into [`followups.md`](../followups.md) or
[`parked.md`](../parked.md) and lost.

Drop them here first. This file is a **queue, not a ledger**: an item
living here means "not yet triaged," not "deferred forever." Triage
happens as a separate pass — each item is read, then routed to its real
home (a specific slice's Open questions, the active
[`followups.md`](../followups.md) ledger, [`parked.md`](../parked.md), a
canonical spec change) or deleted if it dissolves on inspection. Keep
the queue short; a growing inbox is the signal to triage.

A deferral that a **specific downstream slice** will own does not belong
here — it goes straight into that slice's Open questions, where the
slice-planning gate forces its resolution before that slice is planned.

## Inbox

- **Story isolation leaks across files under
  `--fileParallelism=false`.** Serializing puts every story file in one
  page, and some app-level DOM state survives the file that set it.
  Latent rather than active — nothing runs the suite serially — but it
  means "run the browser project sequentially" is not available as a
  debugging move, which is exactly the move a browser-project
  regression calls for. See
  [failed Storybook files with zero failed tests](lessons-learned/storybook-load-flake-zero-failed-tests.md)
  for the parallel-run flake this sits next to; the two may share a
  cause. **Anchor item — accumulating evidence, not yet actionable.**
  Append observations rather than rewriting.

  Evidence so far:
  - 2026-08-24, raised at `384823d6`: the `Diagnostics On` story in
    `app-actions-menu-pure.stories.tsx` failed 2/2, body carrying a
    `data-density` attribute. Attributed to that story; both the
    attribution and the mechanism are unconfirmed.
  - 2026-08-25 at `edce17b8`, three full serial runs (96 files, 803
    tests): green, then a failure in `Trigger Opens Overlay`
    (`preset-browser.stories.tsx`), then green. `Diagnostics On` passed
    all three; `components/compounds` alone is green 26/26. So it is
    intermittent (~1 in 3), the failing story varies across
    directories, and it is not one story's dependency. Root cause
    unidentified — an overlay that fails to open suggests residual
    pointer-events or portal state rather than `data-density`, which
    every file sets for itself through the global decorator in
    `.storybook/preview.tsx`.
  - 2026-10-07, 4.5a: `Trigger Opens Overlay`
    (`preset-browser.stories.tsx:49`) failed once in a 27-file parallel
    run, on `findByText`'s 1 s default, and passed 3 of 3 alone.
  - 2026-10-25, the 2026-10-24 triage pass: `Trigger Opens Overlay`
    failed once in a full parallel Storybook run (145 files) at a
    commit whose `components/wizard/` matched main's, and passed 3 of
    3 alone. The other two full runs that day were green.

  **Revisit trigger.** A browser-project regression that a parallel run
  cannot localise. That is the moment the missing debugging move costs
  something, and the moment a fourth serial run is worth what it takes
  to get. Held rather than routed in the 2026-09-09 triage pass, which
  did not re-run the suite serially — the evidence above is still as of
  `edce17b8`.

- **A scrollbar drag isn't a gesture to the reader's pins.**
  `gestureActiveRef` in `components/reader/reader-surface.tsx` tracks
  touch only, and a scrollbar press interrupts only at pointerdown, so a
  pin that starts during a thumb drag (stream end, viewport shrink, a
  chapter break) can tug the view for about 10 frames. Raised 2026-11-02
  by 5.3's task reviews. Nor is a touch fling's momentum:
  `gestureActiveRef` turns false at `touchend`, so a close's break that
  commits in the first frame or two of an upward fling from the bottom,
  while the reader still reads within ~20 px of it, re-pins against the
  fling, and the viewport-shrink re-pin, older than 5.3, has the same
  guard. [`reader-document.md`](../ui/patterns/reader-document.md#entry-list-fully-rendered-flow-layout)
  counts a touch fling as mid-gesture. Read from the code, not
  reproduced; added 2026-11-03 by 5.3's slice review.

- **A shrinking viewport can pull a landing to the bottom.** The
  surface's `ResizeObserver` (`components/reader/reader-surface.tsx`)
  writes `scrollTop` to the bottom when the viewport shrinks under a
  reader near the bottom, with no landing guard, so an Android keyboard
  opening during a landing that starts near the bottom pulls the reader
  there. Predates Slice 5.3. Read from the code, not reproduced. Raised
  2026-11-03 by 5.3's final review.

- **The reader's bottom geometry is still read only at a few moments.**
  `syncJumpButton` (`components/reader/reader-surface.tsx`) raises the
  jump-to-bottom button as a stream grows below the reader and through
  a landing, but other growth below still waits for a scroll event: the
  commit that replaces a streaming card, a reply's late layout, a
  classifier write that makes a row taller. Separately, the chapter
  break's re-pin reads the reader's distance against the last commit's
  height, and in one story setup late layout had shrunk the content
  14 px since that commit (4 of 4 runs), so a reader 10 px from the
  bottom read as 24 px and wasn't re-pinned; the cause isn't pinned
  down. Both from 5.3's slice review, 2026-11-03, in stories, not on a
  device. The same review left Space on a `<button>` or `<summary>` in
  entry HTML to the control; `<video controls>` and `<audio controls>`,
  which the entry sanitizer allows, may take Space too and weren't
  probed.

- **The theme CSS generator has no runtime caller.**
  `lib/themes/core/css-generator.ts` has had no caller outside its tests
  since M1: `global.css` is written by hand and guarded by
  `lib/themes/core/registry.test.ts`. 5.3 kept the generator in step
  with each dark theme's `--landed-tint-share`, but nothing checks the
  two agree. Wire it into a build step or a test that compares its
  output with `global.css`, or drop it. Raised 2026-11-03 by 5.3's slice
  review.
