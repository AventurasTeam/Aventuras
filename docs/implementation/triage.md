# Implementation triage

Inbox for cross-cutting deferrals surfaced during implementation that
have **no single downstream slice to own them** — the items that would
otherwise be dropped straight into [`followups.md`](../followups.md) or
[`parked.md`](../parked.md) and lost.

Drop them here first. This file is a **queue, not a ledger**: an item
living here means "not yet triaged," not "deferred forever." Triage
happens as a separate pass — each item is read, then routed to its real
home (a specific slice's Open questions, the active
[`followups.md`](../followups.md) ledger, [`parked.md`](../parked.md), a
canonical spec change) or deleted if it dissolves on inspection. Keep
the queue short; a growing inbox is the signal to triage.

A deferral that a **specific downstream slice** will own does not belong
here — it goes straight into that slice's Open questions, where the
slice-planning gate forces its resolution before that slice is planned.

## Inbox

- **`generation-pipeline.md → New-entity emission` "(or piggyback)"
  parenthetical contradicts the memory write-set canon.** The section
  opens "The classifier (or piggyback) creating a brand-new entity…", but
  [`cadence.md → Concurrency`](../memory/cadence.md#concurrency) and
  [`piggyback.md`](../memory/piggyback.md) give piggyback zero creation
  rights — creation is classifier-only (disambiguation lives there by
  design). Surfaced by the M3 promotion audit (2026-07-20). The
  id-allocation mechanic the section describes is correct either way; the
  fix is dropping or rewording the parenthetical. Canonical edit — route
  through a design / cleanup pass, not a planning commit.
- **Every future model-removal path must evict the native session cache.**
  `lib/embedder/local/runtime.native.ts` holds a lazy `bundles`
  `Map<modelId, SessionBundle>`; a removed then re-downloaded model reuses
  its dir, so without eviction the cache keeps serving inferences from the
  deleted model — and the resulting vectors land tagged with the _new_
  model id, so nothing marks them for re-embedding. The hook now exists
  (`evictBundle`) and is wired into the native driver's `deletePartial`,
  mirroring desktop's `evictPipeline`; what remains is that the M7.1
  model-remove flow, and any other future deletion path, must call it too.
  Nothing enforces that mechanically. Surfaced by M3.1a implementation
  (2026-07-20), partially resolved during M3.1a review (2026-07-21).
- **The `onnxruntime-react-native` patch carries two upstream gaps worth
  reporting.** `patches/onnxruntime-react-native.patch` drops a Gradle-9
  incompatibility (`VersionNumber`, removed in Gradle 9, guarding a fbjni
  fallback that only applies below RN 0.71) and adds the
  `react-native.config.js` the package omits, without which RN autolinking
  skips it and `NativeModules.Onnxruntime` is null at runtime. Both are
  upstream bugs, not app-specific workarounds, so the patch has to be
  re-verified on every ORT-RN bump until they land upstream. Decide whether to
  file them against microsoft/onnxruntime. Surfaced by M3.1a review
  (2026-07-21).
- **Custom-import file set may need `config.json` on desktop.**
  [`model-management.md → Custom file import`](../memory/model-management.md#custom-file-import)
  specifies three files (`model.onnx`, `tokenizer.json`,
  `tokenizer_config.json`), but M3.1a found transformers.js fatally
  requires `config.json` to build a pipeline, which is why the curated
  catalog entries carry it. The native runtime constructs its tokenizer
  directly and does its own pooling, so it may not need the file at all —
  making the required set platform-dependent, which the custom-import
  spec doesn't model. Resolve when M7.1 plans the import flow; verify the
  native requirement rather than assuming symmetry. Surfaced by M3.1a
  device review (2026-07-21).
