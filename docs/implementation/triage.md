# Implementation triage

Inbox for cross-cutting deferrals surfaced during implementation that
have **no single downstream slice to own them** — the items that would
otherwise be dropped straight into [`followups.md`](../followups.md) or
[`parked.md`](../parked.md) and lost.

Drop them here first. This file is a **queue, not a ledger**: an item
living here means "not yet triaged," not "deferred forever." Triage
happens as a separate pass — each item is read, then routed to its real
home (a specific slice's Open questions, the active
[`followups.md`](../followups.md) ledger, [`parked.md`](../parked.md), a
canonical spec change) or deleted if it dissolves on inspection. Keep
the queue short; a growing inbox is the signal to triage.

A deferral that a **specific downstream slice** will own does not belong
here — it goes straight into that slice's Open questions, where the
slice-planning gate forces its resolution before that slice is planned.

## Inbox

- **Story-delete cascade must drive asset trashing once refcount-trashing
  lands.** [Slice 2.4](./milestones/02-first-user-loop/slices/04-story-list.md)'s
  `deleteStory` cascade bulk-removes `entry_assets` rows but only drops the
  junction rows — it does **not** trash the now-orphaned `assets` (matching
  M1b/06-content's posture, since refcount-driven trashing is M4/M9 and the
  boot sweep is M9.3). Per the
  [trash-can pattern](../data-model.md#assets-images--future-media), removing
  the last `entry_assets` reference should set `pending_delete_at` + rename to
  `.trash`. When M4/M9 builds refcount-trashing, it must hook the **story-delete
  cascade path**, not just the standalone entry/branch delete arms, or deleting
  a story with assets leaks blobs. No live impact in M2 (M2 stories carry no
  assets). Route into the M4/M9 refcount-trashing slice's Open questions when
  that slice is authored.
- **Store hydrate/rehydrate seam — fold into the store namespace?** Sweep
  every store in `lib/stores/*` (`appSettingsStore`, `storiesStore`, the
  `working-set-store` factory stores, etc.) and decide a single rule: should
  `rehydrate(db)` be a **method on the store object** (`storiesStore.rehydrate(db)`)
  so the store owns its own refresh, instead of a separate free export sitting
  next to it in the barrel? Apply the answer consistently. Concrete cleanups to
  fold in while there: (1) `bootstrap.ts` inlines
  `hydrateAppSettings(() => readAppSettingsRow(ctx.db))`, which is byte-identical
  to `rehydrateAppSettings(ctx.db)` — switch boot to the convenience; (2) once it
  does, `hydrateAppSettings`(thunk) + `readAppSettingsRow` have no production
  callers, so app-settings can collapse to `appSettingsStore` +
  `rehydrateAppSettings` the way stories collapsed in 2.4 (drop the thunk + read
  from the public surface; point the boot-order test at the surviving symbol).
  Cross-cutting (stores layer + boot), no single slice owner.
